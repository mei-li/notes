Here I want to summarise the point in a book that I found more useful for me.

# The power of habit
by *Charles Duhigg*

- Loop: cue - habit - reward
- To build a strong new habit, find a simple cue to trigger the habit and a clear reward, eg when I leave work, after run bath or relaxation.
- When we start **craving** for the reward before it comes, it is when the habit becomes automatic
- Replace bad habit with new, keeping the same cues and rewards
- Toothbrushing/cleaning doesnt keep the fresh feeling or the smell to work it is added cause the reward smell or 
effect, hooks as up
- Secret ingredient in building habits is **belief**
- There are keystone habits that can take in more habits (eg. safety habit in Alcoa, visualise hard point) 
(me: plan your day, week, month, visualise hard points?)
- When something becomes automated habit, it requires no effort
- Starbucks focus in writing down and visualize the challenging moments at work
- Make the new a habit or learn to enjoy it, by disguise it in the familiar
- Take adnvantage of the crisis to establish new habits

## Social habits

The habits of movements. 3 major pieces:
1. Start with strong ties, (people and relations what closely related friendships, work connections)
2. Grow with weak ties and peer pressure. 
3. Become self-perpetuating when values taught, become the identity of participants and they start to spread it.
