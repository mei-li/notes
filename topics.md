# Open source licenses

Source: https://www.activestate.com/blog/the-developers-guide-open-source-software-license-comparison/

Here is a very high level description of the licenses categories for my sole understanding and is not complete.

Categories: 

## Copy left licenses

Enforce that derived versions of the code have to be also freely available. Examples: GPL, Mozilla and Eclipse
## Permissive Licenses

Can redistribute and modify mentioning copyright without licensing restrictions, possibly in proprietary 
software. Examples: MIT, BSD, and Microsoft Public License (Ms-PL).

## Public Domain

No licensing requirements to derived/modified software. Examples: Creative Commons

## Source available

Can be used, but not "as a service" eg. redis, mongoDB. Examples: Redis’ Source Available License (RSAL), MongoDB’s Server Side Public License (SSPL), the Cockroach Community License (CCL)
