# Predicting the Future of Web develpoment

by Richard Feldman, author of Elm in Action

Choose tech:

- Boring tech ----> NO
- What will age well -> best predicting possible

Typescript - hypescript
-----------------------
  -> Coffescript dropped, never picked as much as Typescript
  -> Massive adoption from top frameworks - Vue, Angular, Ember

  -> starts looking like Java in typewise, too much typechecking, it is ugly
  -> + not 100% type safety as there is Any

  -> Teams do not switch to it and later go back to JS

Prediction:
    * end of 2020: Typescript will take over the world
    * end of 2015: more writing typescript daily than JS

Web assembly
------------
    Lin Clark: explains it great
    Machine language in the browser

Usages:
    * improve performance of JS apps -> Not so important seems that it is fast enough
    * Figma: (photoshop in the browser): 
        it is in C++, native apps distributed in browser    
    Browsers like app stores and installers
    Multi MB apps? -> maybe seems to be widely tolerated
    Will JS, HTML stack go away -> No it will be more broad field. eg.
    * Games rendering -> Better with webassembly and C++, than CSS, JS
    
Prediction:
    Webassembly wexpands the webb App pie
        Maybe around 2025

NPM
----
Is npm the feature? Maybe entropic.dev - CJ Silverio JSConf EU 2019

yarn vs github package manager (eg. npm login --registry=...github)

npm attacks: left-pad, event-stream
Takeaway: USE that to avoid npm attacks!!!!!!
npm config set ignore-scripts true # to avoid extra script installation and attacks

Prediction: npm ecosystem will last
    2020: one security incident
    2025: at least one malicisous npm package


Complile to JS
--------------
* Js dialects (Dart, Babel...): similar PROS and CONS of JS
* Other langs (Closure -> JS, occaml -> JS, EML -> JS), Why?
    - Cheat code in hiring good people

ELM
-----
* faster than JS
* less errors - complier finds them
* Error as very nice and polite
* Things normally work

Prediction:
* Js alternatives stay nice and age well (like Elm)
    2020: grow not as facets as TS
